# Cross-Pseudo-Satellite-Segmentation-Bangladesh

This is a machine learning project that uses cross-pseudo labeling for semantic segmentation of satellite images of Bangladesh. The project aims to improve the accuracy of segmentation through collaborative labeling using a combination of manual and automated labeling techniques.
